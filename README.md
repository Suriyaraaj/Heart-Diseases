The dataset used in this project includes various medical attributes that help in determining the likelihood of heart disease in patients. 

The project aims to provide insights into the factors influencing heart disease and build a predictive model using Logistic Regression.

The dataset used for this project includes the following columns:

age: Age of the patient

sex: Gender of the patient (1 = male, 0 = female)

cp: Chest pain type (0-3)

trestbps: Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)

chol: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl

fbs: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true, 0 = false)

restecg: Resting electrocardiographic results (0-2)

thalach: Maximum heart rate achieved

exang: Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes, 0 = no)
oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
slope: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment (0-2)
ca: Number of major vessels (0-4) colored by fluoroscopy
thal: Thalassemia (1 = normal, 2 = fixed defect, 3 = reversible defect)
target: Presence of heart disease (1 = yes, 0 = no)
